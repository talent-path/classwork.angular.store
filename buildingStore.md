## Store products ##

So the first thing for our store is to have products. In this demonstration we'll be storing our products in a Typescript file. Create a new file in your ``app`` folder named ``product.ts``. In here we will export a class named product. Each product will have an id, name, category and an optional description.

```Typescript
export class Product {
    id:number;
    name:string;
    price:number;
    category:string;
    description?:string;
    
}
```

In addition, we will  export an array of products to be used within our application

```Typescript
export const productList :Product[] = [
    {
        id:1,
        name:"Pencil",
        price:1.50,
        category:"Office Supplies",
        description:"graphite surrounded by wood"
    },
    {
        id:2,
        name:"Mechanical Pencil",
        price:2.00,
        category:"Office Supplies",
        description:"graphite surrounded by plastic"
    },
    {
        id:3,
        name:"Pen",
        price:2.00,
        category:"Office Supplies",
        description:"plastic surrounding ink"
    },
    {
        id:4,
        name:"TalentPath Studio",
        price:100.00,
        category:"Software",
        description:"The best code editor"
    },
    {
        id:5,
        name:"Compass",
        price:95.00,
        category:"Software",
        description:"The best learning management software not on the market!"
    }
];
```

Now that we've made some test data to develop with, we can start displaying our products in our store.

## Generating our first component ##

Now that we have some test data to work with we can start building our application. The first thing we're going to do is create two folders in our app folder:

> components
> services

This is just to structure our project. The file structure will vary based on scale of your angular project. Navigate to your integrated terminal and run the command

> ``ng generate component components/all-products``

This will generate a component named all-products in your components folder. Navigate to the all-products.component.ts file


```Typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-all-products',
  templateUrl: './all-products.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./all-products.component.css']
})
export class AllProductsComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }

}
```

In this file, you'll notice a few interesting things generated by angular. First of all there is a ``@Component`` decorator that contains some important information there. 

> first is the ``selector``  property, this represents the ``html tag`` to create that represents this component. 

> second is the ``templateUrl`` this connects the all-products.component.html to this component.
> third is the ``styleUrls`` just like above, this connects the css file to this component


moving in to actual component class, the ``ngOnInit`` function is imported from ``angular/core``. This is a lifecycle hook that runs after the initialization of the component object. We can write code that will set up our component before it renders in this function.
